# Use cases
You plan an integration with ePages?
Thatâ€™s great!
Here are some use cases we can think of:

### Payment solution

Enable merchants to offer more payment options by integrating your own payment solution.
Create your own payment method so that merchants can later activate it for their shops.
This way, a merchant's customers will find a more diverse set of possibilities to pay for their purchase.</br>

For detailed instructions, see our [Integrate a payment solution tutorial](http://docs.beyondshop.cloud/#_integrate_a_payment_solution).

### Social commerce

Enable merchants to use social media platforms like Facebook or blogging platforms to showcase their products.
Put together a custom catalog and redirect customers directly to a shop.
This way, a merchant can advertise with just a few clicks.</br>

### Legal service

Enable automatic updates and notifications to everything relating to legal content.
Retrieve the legal content that merchants display to their customers, give it a check and, if you have the merchant's consent, write an improved version of the texts back to the shop.

### Sales analytics

Enable custom analytics that give merchants the full picture of how well certain parts of their shop are performing.
Aggregate information from orders on products to generate bestseller lists, generate graphs of a shop's performance through time or use postal codes to see what regions a shop is most popular in.
This way, you can present data in a more approachable form to a merchant, and thus help them evaluate advertising campaigns, reconsider their range of products, or plan expansions.</br>

Enable immediate editing of product images, or link a shop up with image sites.
You can offer filtering capabilities and put the edited pictures back into the shop, offer insertion of new images from the app, or create whole slideshows and collages from the available product images.
You can even integrate your app with image sites like Instagram, and give the merchant the possibility to bring images over to their shop, or reversely get product images out on different platforms.
This way, you can make modeling the visual appearance of their shop easier for merchants, and help them with all tasks revolving the presentation of their products.</br>

### Enterprise Management Systems (EMS)

Enable a comprehensive look at a shop's performance and all related workflows by providing a complete system.
Add and delete products or optimize product descriptions.
Give an even more detailed insight by retrieving orders, calculating turnover, or notifying merchants about unpaid orders.
Stock management and customer support can just as well be part of the system.
